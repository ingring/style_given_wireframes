# From wireframe to newsletter

## About the project
This page was created as part of the subject IDG1292 Web coding, a subject on the department of design on NTNU Gj√∏vik. 

## The task
Follow the already created mock-ups and implement the newsletter using CSS. I also recieved a document with the final HTML structure, and 
I was not allowed to modify it. I was also not allowed to use flexbox and grid layout.
